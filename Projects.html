        <h2>Spending Tracker</h2>
        <p>My very first project made using Python. It is a command-line personal finance tool designed to help users understand and manage their daily and weekly spending habits. This tracker stores user-specific data in individual text files and enables long-term tracking without requiring a login system. Users can record the amount spent, mood, category (e.g., food, shopping, bills), and the time of each purchase. </p>
        <p>
  Key features include:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Custom file creation:</strong> Generates and maintains a personalized log for each user based on their name and age.</li>
    <li><strong>Spending logs:</strong> Records purchases with timestamp, mood, and category for better emotional and financial awareness.</li>
    <li><strong>Summaries:</strong> Provides a breakdown of total and average spending by day, week, and month.</li>
    <li><strong>Most frequent category:</strong> Identifies where the user spends the most money.</li>
    <li><strong>Mood analysis:</strong> Highlights the most common mood during purchases.</li>
    <li><strong>Data cleanup:</strong> Lets users delete individual spending entries or reset their entire history.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  This project was built using core Python concepts such as user-defined functions, loops, conditionals, file I/O, and formatted string output.</p>
